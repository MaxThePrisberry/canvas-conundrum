# Canvas Conundrum Server

A Go-based WebSocket server for the Canvas Conundrum collaborative puzzle game. This server manages real-time multiplayer gameplay including trivia rounds, resource collection, and collaborative puzzle solving.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Git

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd canvas-conundrum/server
go mod download
```

2. **Create trivia directory structure**:
```bash
mkdir -p trivia/{general,geography,history,music,science,video_games}
```

3. **Add trivia questions**: Place JSON files with trivia questions in each category directory. See [Trivia Setup](#trivia-setup) for format details.

4. **Start the server**:
```bash
go run .
```

5. **Note the endpoints**:
```
ðŸŽ® HOST ENDPOINT: /ws/host/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
ðŸ‘¥ PLAYER ENDPOINT: /ws
ðŸ”— Host URL: ws://localhost:8080/ws/host/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
ðŸ”— Player URL: ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

## Host vs Player System

Canvas Conundrum uses a dedicated host system for reliable game management:

### Host Connection
- **Endpoint**: `/ws/host/{unique-uuid}` (generated fresh each server start)
- **Role**: Game moderator and controller
- **Capabilities**: Start games, monitor progress, control game flow
- **Limitations**: Cannot participate in trivia or puzzle solving
- **Reconnection**: Can reconnect using same endpoint + player ID

### Player Connection
- **Endpoint**: `/ws`
- **Role**: Game participants
- **Capabilities**: Answer trivia, collect tokens, solve puzzles, select roles
- **Requirements**: Must have host present to start games
- **Reconnection**: Can reconnect using player ID

## Configuration

### Command Line Options
```bash
go run . [options]

Options:
  -env string
        Environment: development, staging, production (default "development")
  -port string
        Server port (default "8080")
  -host string
        Server host (default "0.0.0.0")
  -origins string
        Comma-separated allowed CORS origins (auto-configured for development)
  -cert string
        TLS certificate file for HTTPS
  -key string
        TLS private key file for HTTPS
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# CORS configuration (required for production)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com"

# Admin authentication (optional - enables admin endpoints)
ADMIN_TOKEN="your-secure-random-token"
```

### Game Balance Configuration

Edit `constants/game_balance.go` to adjust:

- **Player Limits**: Min/max players (default: 4-64)
- **Time Settings**: Round durations, puzzle time limits
- **Token Economics**: Resource collection rates, threshold requirements
- **Trivia Settings**: Question intervals, specialty bonuses
- **Puzzle Mechanics**: Grid scaling, fragment movement cooldowns

## API Endpoints

### WebSocket Endpoints
- `GET /ws` - Player connections
- `GET /ws/host/{uuid}` - Host connection (UUID shown in server logs)

### HTTP Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Server health check and status
- `GET /stats` - Current game statistics
- `POST /admin/reload-trivia` - Reload trivia questions (requires admin token)
- `GET /admin/host-endpoint` - Get current host endpoint (requires admin token)

### Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": 1640995200,
  "environment": "development",
  "endpoints": {
    "players": "/ws",
    "host": "/ws/host/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"
  },
  "game": {
    "phase": "setup",
    "hasHost": true,

- Players select roles and trivia specialties
- Host starts game when all players ready

### 2. Resource Gathering Phase
- Players move between QR code stations physically
- Trivia questions asked at timed intervals
- Correct answers earn tokens based on location and player role
- Tokens unlock bonuses for puzzle phase

### 3. Puzzle Assembly Phase
- Players receive individual puzzle segments to solve
- Collaborative grid assembly of completed segments
- Real-time piece movement and position suggestions
- Host can monitor progress and provide guidance

### 4. Analytics Phase
- Individual and team performance metrics
- Detailed breakdown of contributions and collaboration
- Leaderboard and achievement summaries

### Performance Metrics
- WebSocket connection count and stability
- Message throughput and latency
- Game completion rates and duration
- Trivia question distribution and cycling
- Memory usage and garbage collection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No trivia questions loaded"**
- Ensure JSON files exist in all `trivia/{category}/` directories
- Verify JSON format matches the expected structure
- Check file permissions and server file access

**"WebSocket connection failed"**
- Verify CORS origins are configured correctly
- Check firewall settings and port accessibility
- Ensure WebSocket upgrade headers are present

**"A host is already connected"**
- Only one host can connect per game instance
- Previous host may need to disconnect first
- Check for stale connections in server logs

**"Cannot join game at this time"**
- Game may have progressed beyond setup phase
- Player limit (64) may have been reached
- Host may not be connected

### Development Tips

- Use `-env=development` for automatic localhost CORS handling
- Monitor `/health` endpoint for real-time server status
- Check server logs for detailed error messages and game events
- Use `/stats` endpoint to monitor active game state
- Test reconnection scenarios with network interruptions

### Production Considerations

- Always use HTTPS in production environments
- Set up proper firewall rules for WebSocket connections
- Monitor server resources and connection limits
- Implement log rotation and monitoring systems
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Set up health checks for load balancer integration
